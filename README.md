# ðŸ§¬ Single Cell Hashing Data Demultiplexing With HTO Tags
 
This repository contains a comprehensive R script for analyzing single-cell hashing data, enabling the separation of cells based on Hashtag Oligonucleotide (HTO) tags. It leverages the power of Seurat, Harmony, and other essential R packages to demultiplex single-cell data, detect doublets, and perform downstream analyses like dimensionality reduction and visualization.
